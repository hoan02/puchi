# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture Decision

## Status

**Accepted** - 2024-01-15

## Context

We need to decide on the architectural approach for the Puchi language learning platform. The system needs to support:

- Multiple user types (students, teachers, administrators)
- Real-time features (chat, notifications, live lessons)
- Scalable content delivery
- Multi-language support
- Gamification features
- Payment processing
- Analytics and reporting

### Options Considered

1. **Monolithic Architecture**

   - Single application with all functionality
   - Easier initial development and deployment
   - Single database and technology stack

2. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**

   - Loosely coupled services with shared infrastructure
   - More mature patterns and tools
   - Enterprise-focused approach

3. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Independently deployable services
   - Technology diversity per service
   - Domain-driven design approach

## Decision

We will adopt a **Microservices Architecture** with the following characteristics:

### Core Principles

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Each service represents a business domain
- **Independent Deployability**: Services can be deployed independently
- **Technology Diversity**: Each service can use appropriate technology
- **Fault Isolation**: Service failures don't cascade

### Service Boundaries

Based on business domains, we identified these services:

1. **User Service**: User management, profiles, authentication
2. **Lesson Service**: Content delivery, lesson management
3. **Notification Service**: Real-time notifications, messaging
4. **Progress Service**: Learning analytics, progress tracking
5. **Billing Service**: Payment processing, subscriptions

### Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous**: HTTP REST for external APIs, gRPC for internal communication
- **Asynchronous**: Event-driven communication for eventual consistency
- **API Gateway**: Single entry point with routing, authentication, and monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Scalability**: Each service can scale independently based on demand
- **Technology Flexibility**: Can choose best technology for each service
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work independently on different services
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't affect others
- **Deployment Independence**: Services can be deployed without affecting others

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Increased operational and development complexity
- **Distributed System Challenges**: Network latency, eventual consistency
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Tracing issues across multiple services
- **Data Consistency**: Complex distributed transactions
- **Operational Overhead**: More infrastructure and monitoring required

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Service Mesh**: Istio for service-to-service communication
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger for debugging across services
- **Event Sourcing**: For audit trails and eventual consistency
- **Saga Pattern**: For distributed transactions
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2024)

- Set up API Gateway (APISIX)
- Implement User Service
- Basic authentication and authorization

### Phase 2: Core Services (Q2 2024)

- Lesson Service
- Progress Service
- Basic frontend integration

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Q3 2024)

- Notification Service
- Billing Service
- Real-time features

### Phase 4: Optimization (Q4 2024)

- Performance optimization
- Advanced monitoring
- Security hardening

## Review Criteria

This decision will be reviewed based on:

- Development velocity
- System reliability
- Performance metrics
- Team productivity
- Operational complexity
